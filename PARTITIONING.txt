HOW TO EXPORT A LOG INTO A PARTITIONED DATASET:

1) Import the log (XES/CSV/Parquet) into PM4Py:

from pm4py.objects.log.importer.xes import factory as xes_importer
log = xes_importer.apply("C:\\receipt.xes")

2) Export the partitioned dataset with the desidered number of columns:

from pm4py.objects.log.exporter.parquet import factory as parquet_exporter
parquet_exporter.apply(log, "receipt", parameters={"auto_partitioning": True, "num_partitions": 128})

Where 128 can be replaced with any desidered number of partitions.
